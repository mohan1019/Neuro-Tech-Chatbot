# **LLM-Powered Chatbot API for Document Querying and Database Interaction**

A project developed in collaboration with **NeuroTechR3**, designed to integrate an **AI-driven chatbot** to assist users in querying documents and retrieving personalized data from a **NoSQL database**. This chatbot is part of the **R3THA neurorehabilitation platform**, aiding users in their rehabilitation journey by **automating responses, troubleshooting setup issues, and retrieving progress metrics** dynamically.

## Note

This repository contains the details and documentation of the project I worked on in collaboration with NeuroTechR3 company. Due to confidentiality and privacy policies, I am unable to share the source code publicly. However, I have provided insights into the project's architecture, design, and implementation approach.

## **Project Overview**

### **Focus on Flask API Development**  
The core objective of this project was to design and implement a **Flask-based API** that powers the chatbot's document querying and database interaction capabilities. The API handles **query classification, retrieval (RAG and NoSQL), response generation, and visualization** efficiently.  

While a **React-based frontend** was created to test and interact with the chatbot, its primary purpose was to validate the API's functionality rather than serve as a production-ready UI. The emphasis remained on building a **scalable, secure, and efficient backend** that could seamlessly integrate into the **R3THA neurorehabilitation platform**.

### **Objectives**
The primary goal of this project is to develop an **intelligent chatbot** that can handle:
- **Document-based queries** (FAQs, manuals, troubleshooting)
- **User-specific database queries** (fetching rehabilitation progress data)
- **Graphical representation** of progress data (automated graph generation)
- **Secure API access** for seamless integration with R3THA

### **Key Challenges Addressed**
‚úÖ Reducing **manual support overhead** by automating FAQs  
‚úÖ Improving **user engagement** with an interactive chatbot  
‚úÖ Enabling **real-time retrieval of rehabilitation data**  
‚úÖ Providing **visual insights** through dynamically generated graphs  
‚úÖ Ensuring **scalability and security** using cloud-based deployment

## **Project Architecture**
### **System Workflow**
1. **User Query Processing**
   - Users interact with the chatbot through a frontend interface.
   - The chatbot processes the query using an **LLM-powered contextualizer** to maintain conversation flow.

2. **Query Classification**
   - The system determines whether the query is a **document-based query** (RAG) or a **database query** (NoSQL retrieval).

3. **Data Retrieval & Processing**
   - If document-based, the system retrieves relevant content using **Pinecone Vector DB**.
   - If database-based, it converts the query into a **MongoDB aggregation query** using a custom-built **NoSQL agent**.

4. **Response Generation**
   - The chatbot returns a **text response** or a **graph (if required)** using **Matplotlib**.

5. **Final Output**
   - The response is displayed in the chatbot interface.

## **Data Flow**
### 1. **Query Routing Mechanism**
- The **NoSQL vs RAG Classifier** determines whether the query should be handled by the **Knowledge Base (RAG)** or **Database (MongoDB)**.

### 2. **RAG-Based Document Retrieval**
- Documents (FAQs, manuals) are stored in **Pinecone Vector DB**.
- When queried, relevant document chunks are **retrieved and processed using GPT-4o**.

### 3. **NoSQL Query Execution**
- User-specific queries are **converted into MongoDB queries**.
- Retrieved data is either **displayed as text** or **visualized as a graph**.

### **API Response (Postman)**  
Below is a screenshot of a sample Postman request and response of the API. The screenshot shows the first message with the chatbot, where the user‚Äôs message is ‚Äúhi‚Äù.
